								EXAMPLE SCRIPTS
To run the example scripts you must
1. Copy Trigger.app to /usr/local, as the scripts assume that that's where it 	is.
Alternatively, modify the TRIGGER var in basic_setup.sh
2. Run create_basic_setup_webviews.sh first.
sudo create_basic_setup_webviews.sh
This generates the webViews that you need to run your basic setup.
3. Run basic_setup.sh second.
sudo basic_setup.sh

								TRIGGER 0.9 MANPAGE
Usage: Trigger.app/Contents/MacOS/Trigger WEBVIEW_1 COMMAND_1 WEBVIEW_2 COMMAND_2 ... [OPTIONS]
Trigger displays a webView while simultaneously executing a command. Once the command finishes executing Trigger moves on to the next webView/command pair.

WEBVIEW
The local HTML file or HTML string to display
		-f, --file <path to file>
		OR
		-html, --html <HTML string>

COMMAND
The command to execute. Command can be a jamf binary command or one of the accepted non-jamf commands (see below).
		Accepted jamf commands:
		All jamf verbs, although be warned that Trigger has only 
		been tested	with jamf binary versions 9.61 - 9.97, so far.
		Note: Trigger assumes that the binary is in /usr/local/bin/jamf. 
		There's no need to specify full path before the jamf verb,
		unless you've relocated the binary. Trigger needs to be run as 
		root to run jamf commands.
		
		"policy -trigger 'microsoft office'"
		"policy -trigger vlc"
		"recon"

		Check out '/usr/local/bin/jamf help' for more information on 
		the jamf binary.

		Accepted non-jamf commands:
		wait
				Displays the webView until a special url link is clicked.
				What occurs once the link is clicked depends on the url:
				- A link to "next", eg. <a href="next">NEXT</a>, 
				  makes Trigger proceed
				  to the next webView/command pair.
				- A link to "formParse", eg. 
				  <a href="formParse">Submit</a>, will inspect
				  any form values and return the results to stdout
				  before proceeding to the next webView/command pair.
				- A link to "quit", eg. <a href="quit">Done</a>,
				  terminates Trigger.
		sleep
				Displays the webView for the number of seconds specified.
				eg. "seconds 5"
COMMAND,NAME
		If an output file is specified (see '-o, --output' option below), 
		all named commands have their stdout and success status written to 
		this file.
		A command is named by appending a comma followed by the name 
		in quotations.
		eg. "policy -trigger mcafee","McAfee Security Agent"
